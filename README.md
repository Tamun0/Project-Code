The finalised code folder is the main code that was used for the project and its results are shown in the dissertation.
run_fault_ride_through_simulation_AHO - The code that shows the response of each controller towards the disturbance in the grid.
run_harmonic_simulation_AHO_VOC - This code shows each controller rejecting harmonics to produce a clean waveform that represents how strong the power quality is
run_islanding_behavioral_sim - This code shows how GFM and GFL perform when they are no longer connected to the main grid
run_inverter_simulation_v7 - This code shows how droop control operates in both strong and weak grids
run_voc_vs_droop_final1 - This code compares the transient response of both droop control and VOC
run_vsm_smib_detailed_simulation - This code shows how VSM responds to a disturbance and how it powers through the grid.
